# ðŸŽ¨ Etch-A-Sketch

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundation curriculum**, where I created a browser-based version of an **Etch-A-Sketch** toy. This project emphasizes DOM manipulation and CSS layout techniques, specifically using **Flexbox**.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Create a customizable grid for drawing, starting with a default size of 16x16 squares.
- Change the color of the squares as you hover over them, leaving a pixelated trail.
- A button allows users to prompt for a new grid size, with a maximum of 100 squares per side.
- Bonus features include random colors for each square and a progressive darkening effect.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: For the grid generation and hover functionality.
